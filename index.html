        <p>
          FractalFantasy’s Liquid Entropy has an incredibly simplistic and
          minimalist layout, incorporating a canvas filling the entire screen
          where the user can move their cursor around to control the liquid.
          Settings regarding the movement and sound of the liquid can be adjusted
          through a settings panel placed out of the way of the canvas,
          unobtrusively, if you will, with sliders for nine varying options in
          addition to a checkbox for the refraction/reverb setting. Having the
          settings out of the way promotes immersion and exploration with the
          adjustable goo-like canvas, with the settings themselves promoting
          adjustability and replay value. Mouse movement within the canvas is
          extremely smooth though it can become more chaotic through adjusting the
          settings. Whilst some of the settings such as ‘speed’, ‘mouse size’ and
          ‘zoom’ are clear in their functions, others such as ‘gleams’, ‘entropy’
          and ‘worm’ have hard to identify purposes, though this is likely
          intentional to encourage experimentation. The website itself has
          extremely simple characterisation with the main, goo-like canvas and the
          settings box which only features a simple colour triad of purple, black
          and white. However, the purple and white combine to represent sliders
          that adjust each setting and a numerical indicator gives immediate
          feedback, allowing the user to identify how their input will change.
          Ultimately, the main purpose of Liquid Entropy is to grant audiovisual
          feedback based on the user’s input and provide a playful yet almost
          trance-like experience.

        </h2>
        <img src = "limpbodybeat.png" alt = "Limp Body Beat"></img>
        <p>Adult Swim’s Limp Body Beat layout is playful yet somewhat grotesque thanks to its surreal ragdoll-physics incorporated within the main canvas where the user can move their hold and drag the mouse to control the limp body and mess around with the beat. The extra options are placed out of the way of the canvas on the left side, featuring the ‘info’ section as the top option and varying body shapes as the other options, as well as a ‘share’ feature on the bottom right also placed out of the way. The canvas itself can also be rotated to display the body from varying angles. A beat grid is implemented where sound is adjusted depending on the body’s position which determines both pitch and timing of notes. Whilst it’s easy to understand how the system works, due to the ragdoll physics it’s tough to create a satisfying beat though this is almost definitely intentional. Surreal environments and visuals work in parallel to the grotesque body, making a rather unsettling aesthetic that invokes curiosity. The feedback from the body hitting the beat grid is immediate and provides a satisfying audiovisual experience that encourages experimentation and replay value. Overall, the main purpose of Limp Body Beat is to grant audiovisual feedback based on the user’s input and provide a chaotic experience.</p>

        <p>Whilst both Liquid Entropy and Limp Body Beat provide creative audiovisual experiences that strongly encourage replays and experimentation, they accomplish this through varying aesthetic decisions. Where Liquid Entropy is an ambient, almost elegant experience with subtle audiovisual feedback, Limp Body Beat is a chaotic, bold experience with in-your-face audiovisual feedback. However, I recommend trying both out as they’re fun to mess around with in their own unique ways!</p>
